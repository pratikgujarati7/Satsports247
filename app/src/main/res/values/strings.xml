\n\n18. Limited Overs Matches - Individual Batsmen Runs or Partnerships In a limited overs match where an individual batsman or partnership runs are traded in-play and the innings is curtailed or subject to any reduction in overs, then these markets will be settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced. If the innings resumes at a later time, a new market may be formed. If a client wants a position in the new market they are required to place a new trade. If there are any subsequent reductions in overs, exactly the same rules will continue to apply i.e. the market is settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced and a new market may be formed.
\n\n19. Test Matches - Individual Batsmen Runs / Partnerships All bets, open or closed, on an individual batsman or partnership runs shall be void if 50 full overs are not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares prior to that point. Bets on partnership totals make up when the next wicket falls. If a batsman in the relevant partnership retires hurt, the partnership is treated as continuing between the remaining batsman and the batsman who comes to the wicket. A partnership is also treated as being ended by the end of an innings.
